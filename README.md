- Creation of exploratory & explanatory visualizations to explain the data analysis in a clear manner 
- Preprocessing to prepare the data for analysis through machine learning to prevent data leakage
- Machine Learning - training models through the creation of a linear regression model and decision tree regressor model, as well as, analyze R^2/RMSE to further explain the data analysis and to explore which model would be best fit for the data
